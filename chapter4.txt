"Really Loud Music" is her favorite Luna-centric episode.[2]
She hopes that families who watch A Loud House Christmas will see the Loud family's Christmas spirit as a takeaway.[3]
She is of Irish descent.[4]
Prior to auditioning for the role of Luna in the live-action film, she was not very familiar with The Loud House due to being outside the show's targeted age range at the time of auditions. The experience caused her to see how strong the franchise's outreach really was back then.[5]
For her initial audition, she sang the Joan Jett song "Bad Repuation".[5] She also cites Jett as her largest source of human inspiration for her incarnation of Luna.[6]
Coincidentally, an episode of the animated series has a title that references this song, and it is also centrally focused on Luna.
In addition to Jett, Woodward also sees Taylor Swift, Elton John, Phoebe Bridgers[7], Ben Platt, Sarah Paulson, and Jenna Ortega[8] as her idols.
The audition also marked one of the first times that she ever played an electric guitar, as she only played the acoustic guitar prior to then. She even grew to love playing the electric guitar as a result.[5]
It also marked one of the first times she ever cut her hair to pixie cut-length.[9]
The Really Loud House marks the first time she has appeared as a regular cast member on a television series.[6]
She had never rapped before prior to the filming of "The Manager with the Planager".[4]
Her favorite Luna lines from the animated series include:[10]
"STAGE DIVE!"
"I bloody love this song! Sing it like you mean it, Mick!"
"That was awesome, dude!"
Her personal favorite aspect of Luna is how she is a non-conformist.[11]
She hopes that viewers of The Really Loud House will see its method of redefining femininity as a takeaway.[11]
She was initially "petrified from nerves" about having to sing "It's Christmas Time", but after the whole cast began dancing together, she was "the happiest person in the world".[12]
A Loud House Christmas marked her biggest acting role on anything she had ever booked at the time it was filmed, and also her first acting job coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.[12]
